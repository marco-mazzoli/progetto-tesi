The solution is developed as a Python Notebook.
Such notebook is supposed to be run in the Google Colab environment.
All the necessary libraries are imported in the first cell and the custom software and model configurations are dynamically downlaod from GitHub within the notebook itself.

It is hosted on GitHub and it is made accessibile in Colab from there at the links:

The data used is made available by the italian governament and it is hosted in GitHub.
It is also updated daily.
